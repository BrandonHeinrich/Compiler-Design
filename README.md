## What To Do

- Do not fork this repository on Gitlab, instead
- On your development machine, in a location different than your assignment repository, clone this project. Your assignment repository will continue to accumulate all files for the project. 
- Copies the files from this repository to your assignment repository.
- Discard the clone of this repository.
- Implement the required capabilities. 
- When complete, "make clean" to remove object files and executables, use git to add and commit your changes and push the project back up to your repository. Rememger to create an issue in Gitlab with me as the assignee indicating that your submission is ready for grading.
